            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Mochi (餅) is Japanese sticky rice cake used both in savory and sweet dishes.  Mochi is
                 usually made from “sweet rice” (also called Mochi rice and it’s not actually sweet by itself)
                  cooked and pounded until it becomes a paste that is very sticky and smooth, then formed into
                   cakes or blocks.  It is often eaten in New Year’s Ozoni soup or baked with soy sauce.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1 cup</strong> Mochiko sweet rice flour</li>
                <li><strong>3/4 cup</strong> water</li>
                <li><strong>1 1/2 cups</strong> sugar</li>
                <li><strong>3/4 cup</strong> water</li>
                <li>cornstarch</li>
                <li>(Anko sweet red bean paste optional)</li>
                <li>(Green tea ice cream optional)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                    <li>Mix Mochiko and 3/4 cup water in a glass (or other heat proof) bowl and mix well. Add some water if
                    it's too dry, 1 Tbsp at a time.</li>
                    <li>Steam the Mochiko dough (leaving the dough in the bowl) in a steamer for 20 minutes</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, put 3/4 cup water and sugar in a medium pot, cook until sugar dissolves to make sugar syrup</li>
                    <li>Transfer the steamed Mochi into a pot and cook at medium low to low heat, adding and mixing in the sugar
                    syrup. Cook until syrup is completely incorporated, mixing constantly, and the Mochi becomes sticky.
                     Take time and be careful not to burn it.</li>
                    <li>Take the hot Mochi out from the pot onto a sheet pan liberally dusted with cornstarch. Shape and cut as you like.</li>
            </ol>
