            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>When you’re craving something thick, hearty, <em>and soul-soothing</em>,
                 there’s really nothing better than a Japanese curry. Unlike Thai or Indian curries that
                  are thickened with yogurt or coconut milk, Japanese curry gets its richness from a deep,
                   dark roux.</p>
            <p>(If you’re unfamiliar, a roux is a binder made from equal parts fat and flour.)</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <h3>For the Roux</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>4 tbsp.</strong> butter</li>
                <li><strong>4 tbsp.</strong> all-purpose flour</li>
                <li><strong>3 tbsp.</strong> Japanese(or other, but not Madras) curry powder</li>
            </ul>
                <h3>For the Curry</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>2 lb.</strong> boneless, skinless chicken breast and thighs, cut into 1"-2" pieces</li>
                <li><strong>2 tsp.</strong> neutral oil, such as canola or vegetable</li>
                <li><strong>1</strong> medium onion, chopped</li>
                <li><strong>1</strong> large russet potato, cut into 1/2" cubes</li>
                <li><strong>1 1/2 c.</strong> carrots cut into 1/2" chunks</li>
                <li><strong>1/2 c.</strong> grated apple (no need to peel)</li>
                <li><strong>1/2 c.</strong> sliced mushrooms, such as button</li>
                <li><strong>3 1/2 c.</strong> water</li>
                <li><strong>2 tbsp.</strong> Worcestershire sauce, or store bought tonkatsu sauce</li>
                <li><strong>1/2 c.</strong> frozen peas</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <h3>For the Roux</h3>
            <ol>
                    <li>Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the flour and continue to cook
                         and stir until it's a medium brown, approximately 20 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add the curry powder and stir for another minute. Set aside.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>For the Curry</h3>
            <ol>
                    <li>Heat canola oil in a 3-quart saucepan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown the chicken
                         on all sides and transfer to a bowl</li>
                    <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add the onions. Caramelize 5 to 10 minutes. If the pan starts to look
                        dry, add another tablespoon of oil.</li>
                    <li>Add the potatoes, carrots, grated apple, mushrooms and browned chicken to the caramelized onions. Pour
                        the water over it all and stir along the bottom to release any browned bits.</li>
                    <li>Add the roux. Stir to dissolve and then bring to a boil and simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Season to taste with the Worcestershire/Tonkatsu sauce along with salt and pepper. Stir in the frozen peas and serve</li>
            </ol>
